$contenueMotAuteur ="According to the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation, although there is no certainty as to the place of creation of the canvas, it is likely that it was created in Portlligat, shortly after the couple bought a house there In March 1930, and at the beginning of the intense artistic bubbling which marked the accession of the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1936), 2 with the formation of the GATCPAC, for example. Dali was then in full surrealist period; He had been integrated into the circle of the Paris surrealists since 19293 and had recently invented the paranoid-critical method. His relationship with Gala and an accusation of blasphemy on his mother5 had resulted in a breakdown in relations with his family two years earlier2. The artist was in full artistic and personal renewal.

In his autobiographical work The Secret Life of Salvador Dali6,7 the painter explains that after a meal with friends and his wife, he had to accompany the group to the cinema but a migraine taking it he preferred to let them go without him. When they were gone, his gaze was lost in the soft camembert that dragged on his plate. When he thought of it, he recalled the moments spent with his wife; He concluded that with the strong character that she had, she had forged it like a shell that protected him from the outside, but he found that inside it was 'like everything soft.'

Applying his surrealist paranoia-criticism, he left the softness of the Camembert to inspire his imagination and reinterpret his haunting of death, as softness of time, in soft watches. He had already made the bottom of his next picture: the desert landscape of Port Lligat with the rocks, and sketched an olive tree. He added the watches to it during the time of the cinema session.

From this painting which became one of Dalí's most emblematic works, the painter told him that Gala assured him that 'no one can forget it after seeing it'";

$contenueDescription ="In the background is Portlligat's creek, to which Dali was very attached, and which, according to Robert Descharnes, served as a 'backdrop, bearing and stage curtain' to the painter's works. Dali said in this connection:

'Bound forever to that Portlligat - which means bound port - where I defined all my raw truths and my roots. I am at home only in this place; Elsewhere I camp. '

Occupying the upper third of the canvas, and from top to bottom, the painting represents a crepuscular sky overlooking a beach and the Mediterranean. The marine horizon that serves as a vanishing point is the only luminous element of the canvas. The creek, rocks and cliffs of Portlligat are shown on the right. For the Gala and Salvador Dali Foundation, the painter offers a simple and austere vision of nature, a rather static landscape that conveys a certain idea of ​​sterility. Light seems to vitrify the landscape.

The bottom two thirds of the canvas are occupied by the beach where three soft watches and one hard one. The dominant colors are cold. Watches, one suspended from an 'olive branch', 12 the other rests on a cadaveric white form lying on the sand, which is nothing but a distorted representation of the Grand masturbator. This recurrent and obsessive element of Dali since the creation of the homonymous canvas contains a self-portrait of the painter in the form of the rocks of Portlligat which are already represented in the bottom of this painting (the cliffs on the right). Finally, the last two watches rest on the edge of a piece of furniture located outside the viewer's field of vision and of which only one angle is visible in the lower left corner of the work12.

None of these watches indicate the same time, even if the colors and light are those of twilight. Of the last two watches, one is soft and is surmounted by a fly - insect flying and linked to a positive feeling in Dali. The last watch is the only rigid and the only one painted in a warm, orange color, distinctly distinguishing itself from soft watches with cold bluish tones. It is a pocket watch turned on its back and hiding the time accordingly. It is infested with ants - an insect on the contrary, linked to a feeling of horror in the painter. Jean-Hubert Martin suggests that this last is the watch of the father of Dali with which it was deeply blurred";
